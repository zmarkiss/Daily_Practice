#  Finding pets
#  Compile a pattern called pets that matches the following pets: dog, cat, parrot, and hamster.
#  Your pattern must be case-insensitive, so uppercase and lowercase characters must be treated equally

import re


pattern = re.compile('(dog|cat|parrot|hamster)', flags=re.I)
results = pattern.findall(input())
print(results)
